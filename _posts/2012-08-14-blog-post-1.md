1. Some Inferences for Life Time Models When the Observations are Complete and Censored - 1994 by Shastri, Vastoshpati
- Mr. Shastri was recipient of Junior Research Fellowship and soon after the completion of his Ph.D., he joined as Lecturer at Government Post graduate College, Ratlam.
3. Bayesian Analysis for Some Failure Time Distributions - 1994 by Agrawal, Rekha
- Ms. Rekha Agrawal was also recipient of prestigious National JRF award and soon after the completion of her Ph.D., she joined as Principal at an Intermediate College in M.P.
3. Sample Based Approaches for the Analysis of Certain Reliability Models - 1998 by Vasishta, Naveen
- Mr. Naveen Vasishta joined as Ph.D. scholar on deputation from Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, and he returned back to his position after completion of his Ph.D. degree. At present he is Scientist at the Department of Science & Technology, New Delhi.
4. Posterior Analysis for Some Complex Failure Models - 2002 by Meena Peshwani
  - Ms. Peshwani was mainly concerned with the complex failure models mostly untouched in Bayesian literature. In the initial phase she appeared to face a number of computational challenges in her work but finally came up with nice solutions. Her work was very much appreciated by the academic audience during her presentation. She is at present working as Lecturer in a college at Mumbai.
5. Bayesian Analysis via Sample Based Approaches: A Study for Certain Less Explored Failure Models â€“ 2002 by Iftikhar Ahmed Javed
- Mr. Javed was perhaps the first student who took minimum time (almost three years) in completing his Ph. D. thesis. At present he is managing and looking after his own school.

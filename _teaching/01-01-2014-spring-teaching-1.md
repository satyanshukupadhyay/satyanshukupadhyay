In 38 years of my teaching career, I have taught a number of courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma levels. 

At undergraduate level, I have taught full year courses on:
- Sampling Techniques and Design of Experiments
- Fundamentals of Mathematical Statistics
- Applied Statistics
- Introduction to Computers and Programming with FORTRAN
- Elementary courses on Probability Theory and Statistical Inference
- Computer Organization and Architecture (to B.Sc. Computer Science students)

At postgraduate level, I have taught courses on:
- Statistical Decision Theory
- Multivariate Analysis
- Real Analysis
- Statistical Inference
- Bayesian Methodology
- Computer Intensive Statistical Methods
- Survival Analysis (at Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU)
- Various courses for M.Sc. Statistics and Computing

I am also engaged in teaching PhD students at Banaras Hindu University, primarily focusing on Bayesian Statistics and Statistical Computing.

The Department of Statistics, BHU, runs certificate courses for students and teachers from other departments, where I've taught for several years. We also recently started a self-financed diploma course in Statistics and Computing where I've contributed teaching.

Besides theory papers, I have conducted practical classes at all levels - undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma.
